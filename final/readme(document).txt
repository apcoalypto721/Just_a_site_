my friend and i created a site and here is the document for how it works and it's internal intractions



### the descriptions:

The site includes 2 main parts which are HTML and CSS ( there are also some jpg pictures which are not discussed in this topic) 

The relationship between HTML and CSS in website is crucial for creating a visually appealing and well-structured web page. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is responsible for defining the structure and content of the webpage, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and styling of the HTML elements. Here's a breakdown of how they interact:

1. Linking CSS Stylesheets: In the <head> section of your HTML file, you have included several <link> elements that reference external CSS stylesheets. These stylesheets contain CSS rules that define the appearance of the HTML elements on your webpage. For example, the line <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"> links the "style.css" file located in the "css" directory to your HTML document.

2. Selector-Property Relationship: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styling rules to them. In your CSS code, you have used selectors such as element selectors (e.g., body, h1, div), class selectors (e.g., .menu, .bgimg-1), and ID selectors (not present in the provided code). These selectors are used to select HTML elements based on their tag names, classes, or IDs.

3. Styling HTML Elements: Once the CSS selectors have targeted the desired HTML elements, you can apply various styling properties to modify their appearance. In your CSS code, you have used properties like background-image, background-color, font-family, border-radius, color, width, and many others. These properties control the visual aspects of the selected HTML elements, such as background images, colors, fonts, borders, and dimensions.

4. Class and ID Attributes: To establish a connection between HTML elements and CSS rules, you have used class and ID attributes in your HTML code. For example, the <div> elements with the class "menu," "bgimg-1," and "bgimg-2" are selected in the CSS code using the corresponding class selectors (e.g., .menu, .bgimg-1, .bgimg-2). This allows you to apply specific styles to those elements.

5. Inline Styles: Although not present in the provided code, HTML also allows the use of inline styles. Inline styles are CSS styles directly applied to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. Inline styles take precedence over external or embedded CSS stylesheets. However, it is generally considered best practice to separate the CSS code into external stylesheets for better maintainability and organization.

By combining HTML and CSS, you can create visually appealing websites with well-structured content and customized styling. HTML defines the structure and semantic meaning of the content, while CSS provides the visual presentation and layout of that content. The separation of concerns between HTML and CSS allows for better code maintainability and flexibility in designing and updating the website's appearance.

The document for html part of the site 

It includes a DOCTYPE declaration, an HTML element, a head section, and a body section. Here is a breakdown of the different components:

- The <title> element sets the title of the webpage, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- The <meta> elements define metadata for the webpage, such as the character encoding and the viewport settings for responsive design.
- The <link> elements are used to include external CSS stylesheets, such as Google Fonts and Font Awesome, as well as a custom stylesheet located in the "css/style.css" file.
- The <style> block contains CSS code for styling various elements on the webpage.
- The <div class="menu"> defines a container for a navigation menu with links to different sections of the website.
- The <div class="bgimg-1"> and subsequent <div> elements with the class "bgimg-2" and "bgimg-3" define sections with background images.
- The <div class="display-middle"> and <span> elements within the background image sections are used to display text content in the center of the image.
- The <div class="content"> sections contain additional content with headings and paragraphs.
- The <div class="grid"> and <div class="item"> elements create a grid layout for displaying multiple items.
- The <img> elements inside the item containers define images to be displayed.
- The <div class="article"> elements contain paragraphs of text related to each item.
- The <footer> section defines a footer area with social media icons and a copyright notice.

Overall, this HTML code is template for a movie website with sections for navigation, background images, content, and a footer.

# style.css

The style.css file is responsible for defining the visual appearance and layout of elements in your website. It contains CSS rules that control various aspects of the site's design.

## General Styles

- The * selector sets the padding and margin to 0 for all elements on the page, ensuring a consistent spacing throughout.
- The .grid class defines a grid layout for the website, with columns that automatically adjust based on the available space. The grid-gap property specifies the gap between grid items.
- The .item class represents individual items within the grid. It sets a background color, height, and border radius. Additionally, it uses flexbox to arrange the item's content in a column layout and sets a cursor style to indicate interactivity.

## Typography and Layout

- The .article class sets the width, padding, and text alignment for articles within the website, ensuring a centered and visually appealing presentation of the article content.
- The .icon:hover selector defines the hover effect for icons, changing the cursor to a pointer and adjusting the opacity and color to provide visual feedback.
- The footer selector applies styles to the website's footer, including text alignment and padding.
- The .display-middle class positions an element at the center of its parent using absolute positioning and a translation transform.
- The .header-txt class styles the header text, adding letter spacing, setting the background color, and applying animation effects.
- The .content class specifies margins, padding, and a maximum width for the website's content, ensuring proper spacing and readability.
- The .episode class defines the color for episodes within the website.
- The .center class centers the text within its container.

## Navigation and Buttons

- The .menu class is used for styling the navigation menu, positioning it at the top of the page and applying a background color and box shadow.
- The .button class defines the styles for buttons on the website. It sets padding, text alignment, cursor style, and background color, creating a clickable and interactive button appearance. Additionally, there is a hover effect that changes the color and background color when the button is hovered over.
